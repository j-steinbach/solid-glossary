# Solid Glossary

_Defining common terms in the Solid world_


## Document

> the term “document” has become heavily overloaded within Solid, because the boundaries of a document capture more aspects than just the data within.

See  https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2022/12/30/lets-talk-about-pods/#mismatches

## Solid

A 'new' semantic-web-like architecture.

An execution/implemention of PDS.

## CSS

Community Solid Server.

Not to be confused with CSS.

Used to host a PDS?

## Personal Data

In the context of the GDPR: <legal>

Can have different meanings in different communities.
  
Does not mean it belongs to a single person! (My birthday is also relevant for my mother. And it will be saved/storedhandled by different systems/organizations, e.g. the hospital and the gouvernment.)
  
### Ownership and control of data
  
Difficult and confusing legal stuff. TLDR: You can not control your data?

## Data Space

TODO

## PDS / Pod / PODs

PDS can mean either Personal Data Space, Personal Data Store or Personal Data System.

### Personal Data Space

The single-user, personal data space. Stored somewhere (> Store). Forms a system (> System).

It is _personal_ data space, and not _personal data_ space.

### Personal Data Store

The physical storage solution (CSS?) to save, write and a access the data from.

### Personal Data System

The ecosystem that exists with the Personal Data Spaces at its core.

There are horizontal (across Personal Data Spaces) and vertical spaces (across organizations, gouvernments, ...)

## Data Vault/Wallet/...

_Alternative names for PDS?_

## WebID

The ID that identifies a (natural?) person in the PDS world.

## RDF
  
## Provenance
## Serendipity
## Affordance
